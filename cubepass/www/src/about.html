    CubePass is an open-source, lightweight and secure password manager (or password 'keeper' if you will)
    that utilizes a unique and very secure encryption algorithm to store your passwords. This app will replace
    the little piece of paper we all use to write down all our passwords. You can now safely store all your passwords
    on your mobile device, and take them (safely) wherever you go! CubePass does not have access to your device's internet
    connection, so you can rest assured that your passwords are safe from any prying eyes :)
