    CubePass is a open-source, lightweight and secure password manager (or password "keeper" if you will)
    that utilizes a unique and very secure encryption algorithm to store your passwords. This app will replace
    the little piece of paper we all use to write down all our passwords. You can now safely store all of them on your
    mobile device, so you can take them (safely) wherever you go! CubePass does not have access to your device's internet
    connection, so you can be rest assured that your passwords are safe and will not go anywhere :)
